   * Adds all root to leaf node keypaths in {@code map} to {@code keypaths} HashSet.

   * <p>
   * SuppressWarnings was used here and in a few other places in the library. When deserializing
   * the YAML file within the library (in the YamlStringToSpecTreeConverter class), it becomes a
   * LinkedHashMap<String, Object> which is a Map<String, Object>. The value of map could be another
   * Map, or other stuff i.e. List, String, Integer, Boolean. This piece of recursive code assumes
   * that the provided Map fits this criteria, namely that if the value is a Map, then it will
   * always be a Map<String, Object>. Usage of this function is internal in the library where we can
   * guarantee that the map parameter provided is Map<String, Object> where if the Object value is a
   * Map, and it passes the (value instanceof Map) condition, then it must be some Map<String,
   * Object>.
   *
   * @param map the map which we will find all the keypaths for
   * @param keypath the path of keys taken to get to a leaf node in the map
   * @param keypaths a HashSet of Strings which this function will add all the keypaths of leaf
   *     nodes to during the traversal
